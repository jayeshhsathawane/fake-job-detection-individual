- **Flask**
- **Machine Learning (scikit-learn)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **HTML, CSS**
- **SQLite Database**

## 🔍 How the System Works

1. Job posting data is collected from the dataset  
2. Text data is cleaned and preprocessed  
3. TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical features  
4. A trained ML model predicts whether the job is **Fake** or **Real**  
5. The result is displayed via a web interface
